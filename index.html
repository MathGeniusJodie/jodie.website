  <h3>Rational Black-body</h3>
  <iframe loading="lazy" src="blackbody.html" style="width: 100%; height: 186px; margin: -18px; border: none; margin-bottom: 1lh;"></iframe>
  <p>I made this dead-simple rational approximation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">black-body</a> radiation formula.</p>
<pre><code>vec3 blackbody(float t){
    vec3 a = vec3(2.59734600e-07,4.72510121e-07,1.47450666e-07);
    vec3 b = vec3(9.63147451e-04,6.61403216e-04,-2.61032012e-04);
    vec3 c = vec3(8.43099559e+00,-8.07987659e-01,-4.90914001e-02);
    vec3 d = vec3(4.15314246e-07,4.77927333e-07,6.80670967e-08);
    vec3 e = vec3(9.26918288e-04,4.08475977e-04,7.59001852e-05);
    return max(vec3(0), ((a*t+b)*t+c) / ((d*t+e)*t+1.));
}</code></pre>
  <p>Here's a demo on <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lslBWl" target="_blank">Shadertoy</a>.</p>
  <p>A neat feature I don't see often in such approximations is that the luma is always 1, so you can tweak the lighting color without messing with the perceived brightness.</p>

  <h3>Time isn't real man</h3>
  <blockquote>
    “There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.”<br>
    ― Arthur Conan Doyle
  </blockquote>
  <p>Anyone who's taken LSD, pulled an all-nighter, been bored, or fell into a YouTube rabbit knows that time is subjective.
    Brains aren't clocks. They cheat constantly. Compressing sequences of events, deleting traumatic evens, buffering sensory delays, 
    stretching and compressing depending on how arousing whatever you're experiencing is.
  </p>
  <h4>Code Monks</h4>
  <p>Programmers enter multi-hour flow states without fatigue or hunger. Usually helped by autism headphones and chemical stimulants.</p>
  <h4>Bullet Time</h4>
  <p>When put in life-or-death situations, many report time slowing down. It's like the brain temporarily overclocks and hyper-saturates itself with sensory perception.</p>
  <h4>Teleportation</h4>
  <p>Notice how commuting to your job feels like a time skip? It's like mundane regular tasks simply don't exist to us.</p>
  <h4>Time Travel</h4>
  <p>When you travel, a few weeks turn into a whole-ass chapter of your life. A giant exotic memory palace. At the end you often feel like you're leaving an entire life behind.</p>
  <h4>Time Merchants</h4>
  <p>Video platforms optimize for smoothness and hyperstimulus. They make you forget where videos start and end.</p>
  <h4>Chronohacking</h4>
  <p>Time perception seems to me like a fertile ground for exploits. It's not just fun, it feels <em>necessary</em> in a world where attention is farmed and sold. 
    There's only so much we can do to have a longer life, so why not try to make our life <em>denser</em>.</p>
</article>
<article id="information" class="math">
  <time datetime="2025-05-15">May 15, 2025</time>
  <h3>Graphics Optimization is Information Theory</h3>
  <p>I've been working on an image compression format lately (coming soon!). This led me down the rabbit hole of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory" target="_blank">information theory</a>, and it's made me see graphics programming with a fresh perspective.</p>
  <p>Information theory is criminally underrated in the context of graphics optimization. It’s not just adjacent to what we do. It's the whole darn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation" target="_blank">map</a>!</p>

  <h4>Compute Generates Data</h4>
  <p>Information theory teaches us that any data with redundancy can be compressed or skipped entirely.
    This principle applies just as well to compute as it does to storage.</p>

  <h4>Less Data Also Matters</h4>
  <p>Low-end hardware is usually bottlenecked by memory bandwidth, not compute. Phones and IGPU powered laptops also tend to have less vram!</p>
  <p>Making things smaller also makes space for something else, like lookup tables or acceleration structures that would be unviable otherwise</p>

  <h4>Where?</h4>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Temporal Redundancy:</strong> The current frame is often similar to the previous one. Reprojection, TAA, and impostors exploit this to reduce work.</li>
    <li><strong>Derived Data:</strong> Don’t store what you can calculate. Like normals and positions from depth.</li>
    <li><strong>Spatial Redundancy:</strong> Adjacent pixels are often the same material and are similarly lit.</li>
    <li><strong>Impossible States:</strong> If the camera can’t possibly see it. Cull it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Human Perception has a Limited Bitrate</h4>

  <p>If there's more of one type of information, you can perceive less of another.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>High Frequency, High Contrast Detail:</strong> Allows for lower bit depth especially for chroma.</li>
    <li><strong>High Motion:</strong> Lower resolution is fine.</li>
    <li><strong>Low Motion:</strong> More temporal redundancy.</li>
    <li><strong>More Pixels and More Frames:</strong> Temporal tricks and dithering shine at high framerate and resolution.</li>
    <li><strong>Blur:</strong> Rough reflections and depth of field need more rays or more texture samples, but you can use a lower resolution for raytracing and texture lookups.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Some Quick Tips</h4>
  
  <ul>
    <li>One texture + different vertex colors = many looks.</li>
    <li>If your floating point data is only positive, put data in the sign bit.</li>
    <li>If float data is always &lt; 1, there's a free bit in the exponent.</li>
    <li>The least significant bit of a float probably doesn't matter. Yolo.</li>
    <li>Float precision issues are often skill issues. Use <a href="https://herbie.uwplse.org/">Herbie</a> and floatfloat methods before giving up and using larger types.</li>
    <li>Decouple framerates. Shadows, GI, terrain and entities don't all need to update at the same frequency.</li>
    <li>Quantize vertex positions</li>
    <li>Paletting</li>
    <li>Checkerboarded chroma</li>
    <li>Lower LODs = fewer animation frames needed</li>
    <li>Velocity buffers: 2D and a low bitrate are often enough</li>
    <li>Normalized vectors can be stored in 2D</li>
    <li>Impostors only need to be loaded for what faces the camera and this makes them extremely overpowered</li>
    <li>Learn about sparse bit octrees/contrees</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Fast Approximate Length and Squaring</h3>
  <p>Shifting a float by 1 approximately squares or square-roots it very quickly. This is probably useful for RMS error calculation or getting the length of a vector.</p>
  <pre><code>static float garbage_len(float a, float b){
  return utf(ftu(
      utf(ftu(a)&lt;&lt;1u)

<h3>Why Productivity and Happiness are the Same Thing</h3>
<p>One of the categories on this blog used to be called "Productivity and Happiness" (now renamed to "life"). I wanna expand on this, because I think it's one of the foundations of what makes for a successful life. Conversely I want to hammer home that the idea of work-life balance is incredibly pernicious.</p>
<h4>Work isn't Hard</h4>
<p>I think it's a sad reflection of the society we live in that work is widely accepted to be difficult and unfun. We shouldn't simply accept that we're forced to do something that sucks. This framing isn't just bad for you, it makes workers as a group accept terrible working conditions. This shouldn't be considered "normal". This is a tragedy!</p>
<h4>Fun isn't Easy</h4>
<p>The other side of the coin isn't much better. Most people's idea of fun is spending money and engaging in vice. Fun is seen as synonymous with being counter-productive. You're expected to continuously destroy what you build in an endless cycle of consumption that never leads to your life improving.</p>
<h4>Work-Life Maximisation</h4>
<p>Productivity and happiness aren't opposing forces that need to be balanced. They aren't at odds with each-other. Work can be fun, and leisure can be productive. An activity can be more fun <em>and</em> more productive. What you want isn't "balance". You want work-life <em>maximisation</em>.</p>

  <h3>Story</h3>
<p>there's a voicemail full of excuses<br>
you haven't listened to yet</p>

<p>I wonder if you miss me like I do<br>
if you'll rewind the tape to hear my voice</p>

<p>your scarf still hangs by my door<br>
waiting for you to walk in</p>

<p>I watch the snow fall outside my window<br>
I trace your name in the condensation</p>

<p>I don't think I feel sad anymore<br>

  <h3>Stop Having Goals</h3>
  <p>Humans aren't made to have long-term goals. If you have a goal, don't think about the goal. Stop caring about the goal. Failure to achieve the goal is neutral. Do not let yourself think about it. Not having reached the goal yet should never be on your mind.</p>
  <p>Learn to enjoy the process. Want to be strong? Learn to enjoy exercise. Want to lose weight? Learn to enjoy hunger. Want to be rich? Learn to enjoy saving money. Want to make friends? Learn to enjoy being interested in people. Do it without an agenda.</p>
  <p>Do the process every day, prioritise it, make it a part of your schedule. Get good at the process.</p>
  <h4>But...</h4>
  <p>Ask yourself if the process is still serving you. Maybe you're already past the goal.</p>

<article id="addicted" class="life">
  <time datetime="2024-11-27">November 27, 2024</time>
  <h3>Do you actually enjoy this or are you addicted?</h3>
  <p>Things that are pleasurable aren't necessarily addictive, and things that are addictive aren't necessarily pleasurable.</p>
  <p>Addiction is a cycle of craving (unpleasant), a short hit of meaningless pleasure (optional), followed by a sense of emptiness (also unpleasant).</p>
  <h4>Why it Doesn't Feel That Way</h4>
  <p>Addiction is a trickster. It makes you rationalise your addiction, convincing you that you actually need it and that you truly enjoy it. If you didn’t need it, it would mean you were being unproductive. If you didn’t enjoy it, it would follow that you were hurting yourself. To not rationalise addiction is to feel guilty, helpless, and foolish.</p>
  <h4>Hidden Addiction</h4>
  <p>Things you recognise as unpleasant often fly under the radar. They are frequently not identified as addictive. Pleasant things also often don't register as addiction. You just think you're doing them repeatedly because they are fun.</p>

	<p>I might get a foldable phone and/or a physical keyboard in the future, but honestly I'm not in a rush.</p>

  <h3>The Most Ergonomic Desk is No Desk At All</h3>
  <p>About a year back, I moved into a new apartment and couldn't bring my desk. I figured I could just work at the kitchen table or on the sofa in the meantime. My plan was quickly thwarted by my new roommate's cat, who I would come to learn, was the most annoying cat in the world.</p>
  <p>Having no money for a desk at the time, I just sat on the floor in my room, and after a short adjustment period, I found that I had developped a new superpower. I could simply sit on the floor with no back support, and it was fine.</p>
  <p>After a few months of this, I decided to buy a desk, and I found that I couldn't sit at it for more than a few hours without my back hurting. So I went back to sitting on the floor, and later donated the desk.</p>
  <p>I haven't bought any furniture since, and I don't plan to. People didn't have furniture for most of human history, and many people in the third world still don't. This isn't as weird as it sounds.</p>

  <h3>Get Off Your Phone</h3>
  <p>Do you feel like you have no time? No energy? Check your screen time in your phone settings. Mine was <em>eight</em>! If you had asked
    me to estimate, I would have said 2! I had no idea! That's a full-time job!</p>
  <h4>How I Regained Control</h4>
  <p>Here's what allowed me to cut my screen time down to 1-2 hours a day:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>I started sharing my screen time with my friends every day to keep myself accountable</li>
    <li>I removed time wasting apps from my home screen</li>
    <li>I added the screen time widget to my home screen</li>
    <li>Apps like Instagram allow you to make widgets to take you directly to direct messages, or you can use an app like Beeper</li>
    <li>Silent notifications! I don't feel like checking the app, but it also doesn't distract me by buzzing</li>
    <li>I don't check my phone first thing in the morning, I get up and work</li>
    <li>I try to smell the flowers and enjoy being bored</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Should I Buy the Thing? A Flowchart</h3>
  <pre>
Am I happy? - Yes: You don't need the thing to be happy, don't buy the thing.
            \  No: Will the thing make me happy?  - Yes: Buy the thing.
                                                  \  No: Don't buy the thing

  <h3>Bit Arrays for Fast Graph Search</h3>
  <p>One problem with every implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world" target="_blank">hierarchical navigable small worlds</a> I've seen is the use of ordered sets to keep track of visited neighbors. This causes a huge performance overhead.</p>
  <p>After much experimentation, I've found that using a bit array to keep track of visited neighbors is much faster.</p>
  <p>For a code example, see <a href="https://github.com/MathGeniusJodie/joann" target="_blank">Joann</a>, my HNSW implementation.</p>
