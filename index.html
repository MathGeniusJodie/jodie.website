	<h3>My Meditation Method</h3>
	<p>No matter how wise I feel, staring at a wall always gives me new insights, and it doesn't take long either, I like to take off my glasses so the wall is blurry, and wearing headphones with white noise too.</p>
	<p>I try to think about nothing, but thoughts always come up, and when they do, I write them down in my notebook.</p>
	<p>Trying to think about nothing makes you really analyse all your thoughts non-judgementally and forces you to reframe them in a way that they stop bothering you, because if they still bother you. good luck thinking about nothing.</p>
	<p>Writing down your thoughts is also important, it frees your mind from having to remember, and you can always come back to them later.</p>
	<p>I'm starting to think that the key to creativity and introspection is just being extremely bored and understimulated, ideas always come.</p>

	<h3>A Programmer Without a Computer</h3>
	<p>I've been using my phone as my main computer for a week now, I'm even coding on it, and it's... fine?</p>
	<p>I'm writing this blog post on my phone right now in fact. Just using termux, neovim and unexpected keyboard.</p>
	<p><img src="4-neovim.png" alt=""></p>
	<p>I might get a foldable phone and/or a physical keyboard in the future, but honestly I'm not in a rush.</p>

  <h3>The Most Ergonomic Desk is No Desk At All</h3>
  <p>So about a year back, I moved into a new apartment and couldn't bring my desk, I figured I could just work at the kitchen table or on the sofa in the meantime, but that plan was quickly thwarted by my new roommate's cat, who I would come to learn, was the most annoying cat in the world.</p>
  <p>Having no money for a desk at the time, I just sat on the floor in my room, and after a short adjustment period, I found that I had developped a new superpower, I could simply sit on the floor with no back support, and it was fine, in fact it was better than fine, it was better than sitting on a chair.</p>
  <p>After a few months of this, I decided to buy a desk, and I found that I couldn't sit at it for more than a few hours without my back hurting, so I went back to sitting on the floor, and later donated the desk.</p>
  <p>I haven't bought any furniture since, and I don't plan to, people didn't have furniture for most of human history, and many people in the third world still don't, this isn't as weird as it sounds.</p>

  <h3>Get Off Your Phone</h3>
  <p>Do you feel like you don't have any time? Do you feel like you don't have any energy? The culprit might just be that you spend 8 hours or more a day on your phone. Go ahead, check your screen time in your phone settings right now... </p>
  <h4>A rude awakening</h4>
  <p>When I first did this, I was shocked, I had absolutely no idea, I would have guessed 2 hours a day maximum if you asked me to estimate, but the software doesn't lie, I was spending 8 hours a day on average on my phone. That's a full-time job!</p>
  <h4>What you can do</h4>
  <p>Here's what worked for me and allowed me to cut my screen time down to 1-2 hours a day:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Share a screenshot of your screen time to a group chat of your friends every day or week, to keep yourself accountable</li>
    <li>Remove anything that you can doomscroll off your homescreen, in fact, consider removing the app entirely.</li>
    <li>Add a screen time widget to your homescreen, this will remind you how much time you've spent on your phone today.</li>
    <li>Apps like Instagram allow you to make widgets to take you directly to messages</li>
    <li>Instead of checking apps constantly for new messages, turn on silent notifications, your phone won't vibrate, but you'll know if there's activity without having to open the app</li>
    <li>Consider making more of your notifications silent</li>
    <li>Don't check your phone in the morning, get up and work or do your morning routine right away</li>
    <li>Embrace boredom, don't reach for your phone when you're bored, think, meditate, smell the flowers, etc.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Should I Buy the Thing? A Flowchart</h3>
  <pre>
Am I happy? - Yes: You don't need the thing to be happy, don't buy the thing.
            \  No: Will the thing make me happy?  - Yes: Buy the thing.
                                                  \  No: Don't buy the thing

  <h3>Bit Arrays for Fast Graph Search</h3>
  <p>One problem with every implementation of the HNSW paper I've seen is the use of ordered sets to keep track of visited neighbors, this causes a huge performance overhead.</p>
  <p>After much experimentation, I've found that using a bit array to keep track of visited neighbors is much faster.</p>
  <p>For a code example, see <a href="https://github.com/MathGeniusJodie/joann">Joann</a>, my HNSW implementation.</p>
